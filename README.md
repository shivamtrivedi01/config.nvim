this is my custom changes to kickstart.nvim.

this directory contains neovim config as well as the tmux configs. I may add
all the other configs here it self

1. You know the steps to setup neovim.
2. Install tmux.(Tested on 3.4)
3. Create a sym link of the .tmux.conf in your ~/.tmux.conf.
4. Put the tmux-sessionizer content in ~/.local/bin/tmux-sessionizer directory.
5. sudo chmod +x ~/.local/bin/tmux-sessionizer
5. install fzf
